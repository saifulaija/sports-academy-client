- To develop a website with admin functionality for user and class management, several key steps need to be taken. First, establish user roles such as "Admin," "Instructor," and "Student" and implement user authentication using a service like Firebase. Next, set up a database to store user information, class submissions, and transaction details. Create an admin dashboard accessible exclusively to administrators, where they can review and approve class submissions, manage user accounts, and update roles. Instructors can submit class details, which initially have a "Pending" status. Admins can then evaluate these submissions and either approve or reject them, changing the class status to "Approved" upon approval. On the public side of the website, display only "Approved" classes to students. Implement a secure payment processing system, such as Stripe, for handling class payments and store payment data securely. Additionally, allow admins to view, edit, and manage user accounts, including changing roles. Ensure data security, validation, and user-friendly interfaces throughout the website. Finally, rigorously test the website to ensure it functions correctly and deploy it to a web server or hosting service while maintaining data privacy and security standards.
